# Spectral Normalized Neural Gaussian Process (PyTorch Implementation)
PyTorch implementation of SNGP as found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10108.pdf
This repo follows the implementation found at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/understanding/sngp but using PyTorch.
Please note that this has been developed entirely for personal use. It has been made available in case it can be of value to ML practitioners.
