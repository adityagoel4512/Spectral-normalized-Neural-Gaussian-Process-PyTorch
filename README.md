# Spectral Normalized Neural Gaussian Process (PyTorch Implementation)
PyTorch implementation of SNGP as found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10108.pdf.

This repo follows the implementation found at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/understanding/sngp but uses PyTorch instead since there is no reference PyTorch implementation.

Please note that this has been developed entirely for personal use. It has been made available in case it can be of value to ML practitioners.
