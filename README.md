# Spectral-normalized-Neural-Gaussian-Process-PyTorch
PyTorch implementation of SNGP as found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10108.pdf
This repo follows the implementation found at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/understanding/sngp but using PyTorch.
This was developed entirely for personal use but has been made available in case it is of value to others.
